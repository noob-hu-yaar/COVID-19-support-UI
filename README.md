I tried making a <b>COVID-19 support UI</b> using <i>Flutter</i> and <i>Dart</i> language.
<p>.</p>


Quite a basic app which is cross platform and hence works on <b>Android, IOS and web browsers</b> (like Chrome).\
There are two pages in the app, the home page and the statistics page. The home page shows facilities like calling and sending sms to the help centre, precautionary measures to avoid COVID-19 and also to choose our residing country from the drop down list at the top.\
Whereas the Statistics page shows the present number of cases, deaths and recoveries.\



Here is a screen recording of the app on an Android platform. -\

PS: The App is not in fully developed stage, as I have made it for learning purpose only.\
Will try to improve the App later, by providing additional facilities.
